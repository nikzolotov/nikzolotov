        <p>
          Azbuka Vkusa, one of the top Moscow retailers, decided to test the
          self-checkout process in their supermarkets. So they were planning to
          replace cashiers in the future. I have designed a user interface for
          self-checkout kiosks. Illustrations were outsourced according to my
          sketches. Self-checkout kiosks are now successfully working in
          Azbuka's supermarkets.
        </p>
        <p>
          UPD 2019: Azbuka rolled down self-checkout due to high maintenance
          fees.
