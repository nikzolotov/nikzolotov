          Gulfstream offers people security systems for homes and offices. At
          first, they had a single-button application to switch your home alarm
          on and off with some payment and user management functions. I was
          hired to add some smart home features, such as controllable outlets,
          temperature sensors and make the app look fresh and friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with a competitor analysis and requirement gathering. We
          accepted industry standard of a dashboard so that user can choose
          which devices he wants to see on the main screen. I wanted to create a
          feeling that everything is under control. I offered simple and clean
          visual style with a lot of micro-animations. I made prototypes with
          Hype, to show how it looks and feels.
